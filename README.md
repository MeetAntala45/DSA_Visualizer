# DSA_Visualizer

DSA_Visualizer is an interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides visual representations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 

This project is aimed at helping learners understand and visualize how different data structures like Stack, Queue, Deque, Linked List, and sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort works.

## Features

- **Stack Visualization**: Visualizes the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) operations of a stack with push, pop, and peek functionalities.
- **Queue Visualization**: Visualizes the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) operations of a queue with enqueue, dequeue, and peek functionalities.
- **Deque Visualization**: Visualizes the double-ended queue operations allowing insertion and deletion at both ends.
- **Linked List Visualization**: Demonstrates how elements are linked together in a sequence using nodes, supporting operations like insert, delete, and traversal.
- **Bubble Sort Visualization**: Shows the step-by-step process of sorting an array of elements using the Bubble Sort algorithm.


## Usage

1. Select the data structure or algorithm you want to visualize from the navigation menu.
2. Interact with the visualizer by performing operations (e.g., push, pop, enqueue, etc.).
3. Observe how the data structure or algorithm behaves step by step.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Adds styling and layouts to the application.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the core logic and interactivity of the visualizations.
